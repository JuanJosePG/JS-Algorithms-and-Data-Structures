One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

Module operation:
[A]     65  <=>   0 + 13  =>  13 % 26  <=>  13 + 65 = 78 [N]
...

Expected results:
- rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC"): "FREE CODE CAMP"
- rot13("SERR CVMMN!"): "FREE PIZZA!"
- rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT."): "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG."
